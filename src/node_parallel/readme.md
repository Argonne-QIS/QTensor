The `Node parallelism.*` are two files with same contens but different format.
They are were used to profile the performance on synhtetic tests.
The results are hardcoded and plotted in .ipynb.

the `node\_parallel.py` contains same code as `Node\_parallelism.py`, but it was used in the full contraction package.
